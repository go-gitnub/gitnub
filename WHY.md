## Why?

When I first brought the idea for GitNub to mint, she responded with "Why?" I'll be honest, I really did not know the answer to that question back then. But now, I'll try and explain it.

### GitHub Used to be Good

Back when GitHub was first introduced, it didn't rely on the fancy JavaScript techniques popular at the time. All of it was rendered server-side, and there was little DOM manipulation. It was simple, and it didn't place any unnecessary burdens on the browser.

### GitHub also looks good, especially back in the day

Have you even _seen_ GitHub back in 2010? It was _beautiful_.

All those gradient buttons and menus, no client-side rendering or manipulation need. It was great.

I missed that GitHub. So, I wanted to go back to it. I wanted to have my _own_ GitHub that I could use on my own servers.

And voila, GitNub was born.
